# Drawbacks of Databases

# 1. Complexity:
# Setting up, designing, and maintaining a database can be complex and time-consuming,
# especially for large-scale systems with many interrelated components.

# 2. Cost:
# Databases can be expensive due to the cost of hardware, licensed software (like Oracle, SQL Server),
# skilled personnel (DBAs, developers), maintenance, and infrastructure.

# 3. Scalability Challenges:
# As the volume of stored data grows, managing and scaling the database efficiently becomes harder.
# Performance issues may arise if scaling is not handled properly.

# 4. Data Integrity:
# Maintaining the accuracy and consistency of data is challenging,
# especially in systems where multiple users are performing concurrent operations.

# 5. Security:
# Protecting databases from unauthorized access, data breaches, and cyber attacks requires advanced security mechanisms,
# which can be difficult to implement and manage effectively.

# 6. Data Migration:
# Migrating data between different database systems or during upgrades can be risky and time-consuming.
# It often involves compatibility issues and potential data loss or corruption.

# 7. Flexibility Limitations:
# Databases often follow a predefined schema (especially in relational databases),
# which can make it hard to adapt to evolving business requirements or to store new types of unstructured data.
