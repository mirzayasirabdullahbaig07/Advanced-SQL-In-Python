#  What is DBMS?
# A Database Management System (DBMS) is a software system that provides an interface and tools
# to store, organize, retrieve, and manage data in a database.
# It acts as an intermediary between the database and the applications or users that access the stored data.
#
#  Analogy:
# Think of the database as the main boss (data holder), and the DBMS as the secretary who manages
# and organizes everything—giving access only when needed and making sure everything runs smoothly.

#  DBMS Architecture
# Hardware & Memory → Operating System → Database → DBMS → Users/Applications

#  Key Features of a Database
# • A database consists of multiple tables.
# • To operate and manage a database effectively, a DBMS is required.

#  Functions of DBMS

# 1. Data Management
#    → Store, retrieve, and modify data efficiently.

# 2. Data Integrity
#    → Maintain accuracy, consistency, and reliability of the data.

# 3. Concurrency
#    → Allow multiple users to access and modify data at the same time safely.

# 4. Transaction Management
#    → Ensure that all database operations are completed successfully or not at all (Atomicity).

# 5. Security
#    → Allow access only to authorized users and ensure data protection.

# 6. Utilities
#    → Handle tasks like data import/export, user management, backup, and logging.
