# ================================
# What Are the Top Types of Databases?
# ================================

# Relational Databases –
# Also known as SQL databases, these use a relational model to organize data 
# into tables with rows and columns. Ideal for structured data and relationships.
# Example: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle
# Use Case: A retail company storing customer orders, products, and payments 
# in separate but related tables.

# NoSQL Databases –
# These are designed to handle large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data,
# such as documents, images, or videos.
# Example: MongoDB
# Use Case: A blogging platform storing posts, comments, and images in flexible formats.

# Column Databases –
# These store data in columns rather than rows, making them very efficient for
# analytical queries and big data workloads.
# Example: Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery
# Use Case: A data analyst performing complex queries on millions of rows of sales
# and marketing data for business intelligence dashboards.

# Graph Databases –
# Used to store and query graph-structured data like relationships between entities.
# Example: Neo4j, Amazon Neptune
# Use Case: A social media app storing user connections, likes, and follow relationships.

# Key-value Databases –
# These store data as key-value pairs, suitable for fast data retrieval and caching.
# Example: Amazon DynamoDB
# Use Case: An e-commerce app storing product availability and session data for quick access.

# ==============================================
# Which One Should a Data Analyst Use?
# ==============================================

# Recommendation:
# For data analysts, **Relational Databases (SQL)** and **Column Databases** 
# are most commonly used.

# - Use **Relational Databases** like MySQL or PostgreSQL for structured datasets 
#   with defined schemas (e.g., sales, inventory, customer data).
# - Use **Column Databases** like Amazon Redshift or BigQuery for large-scale 
#   analytics, data warehousing, and fast aggregation over big datasets.

# Tools like Power BI, Tableau, and Python (Pandas) integrate very well with 
# both SQL and columnar databases for analysis and visualization.
