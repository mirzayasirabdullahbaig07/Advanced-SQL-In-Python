# Properties of an Ideal Database
# ===============================

# Integrity:
# The data in the database should be accurate and consistent at all times.
# Example: In a banking system, if you transfer money from Account A to B, 
# both accounts should reflect the correct updated balances â€” no loss or duplication.

# Availability:
# The database should be highly available, meaning users can access it at any time.
# Example: Online shopping apps like Amazon ensure their product and order databases
# are available 24/7 for customers all over the world.

# Security:
# Databases often store sensitive and critical information, so access should be secure.
# Example: A hospital's patient database must be protected so that only authorized
# doctors and staff can access patient records.

# Independence from Application:
# The database should be independent of any specific application, allowing multiple
# systems to interact with it without conflict.
# Example: A university database can be used by the admission portal, student portal,
# and admin dashboard without creating separate databases for each.

# Concurrency:
# Multiple users should be able to access and modify the database simultaneously
# without interfering with each other.
# Example: During a flash sale on an e-commerce site, thousands of users may place
# orders at the same time. The database must handle all those operations without
# conflicts or data loss.

# =====================================
# These properties ensure that databases
# are reliable, efficient, and scalable
# for real-world applications.
