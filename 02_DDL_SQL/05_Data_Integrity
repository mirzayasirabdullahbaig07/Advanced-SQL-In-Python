# DATA INTEGRITY IN DATABASE SYSTEMS
# ----------------------------------------

# Data integrity refers to the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of the data stored in a database.
# It is a measure of the reliability and trustworthiness of the data.
# Ensuring data integrity means protecting the data from:
# - Errors
# - Corruptions
# - Unauthorized modifications

# Methods to Ensure Data Integrity:

# 1. Constraints:
#    Constraints are rules or conditions applied to table columns that restrict the type of data
#    that can be stored. They enforce integrity by ensuring valid data entry.
#    Examples:
#    - PRIMARY KEY
#    - FOREIGN KEY
#    - UNIQUE
#    - NOT NULL
#    - CHECK

# 2. Transactions:
#    A transaction is a sequence of one or more SQL operations executed as a single unit.
#    It ensures data integrity using the ACID properties:
#    - Atomicity
#    - Consistency
#    - Isolation
#    - Durability

# 3. Normalization:
#    Normalization is a database design technique that reduces data redundancy and improves consistency.
#    It organizes data into multiple related tables and defines relationships between them.
#    Normal forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, etc.) help structure the data correctly.

# Summary:
# Data integrity is critical for reliable, accurate, and secure database systems.
# Using constraints, transactions, and normalization are best practices to maintain high data quality.
